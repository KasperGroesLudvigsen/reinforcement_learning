707 Deep Reinforcement Learning coursework @ City, University of London

## Task 1
This folder contains the environments we developed. Only britneyworld.py and assassinworld.py ended up being used

## Task 2
Individual task. See file submitted on Moodle. 
## Task 3
This folder contains out implementation of a Soft Actor Critic that is adapted for a discrete action space. You can plot the results of our experiments via the notebook, but unfortunately the results can only be reproduced by running the experiment files (python). The files that have "experiment" in them are python files that can be run to reproduce our experiments. 
## Task 4
Here, we extend our SAC algorithm with Automatic Entropy Tuning and Emphasising Recent Experiences
## Params
This folder contains python files in which the parameters we used for the experiments are defined
