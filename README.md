## Task 1
This folder contains the environments we developed. Only britneyworld.py and assassinworld.py ended up being used

## Task 2
Individual task. See file submitted on Moodle. 
## Task 3
This folder contains out implementation of a Soft Actor Critic that is adapted for a discrete action space. You can plot the results of our experiments via the notebook, but unfortunately the results can only be reproduced by running the experiment files (python)
## Task 4
Here, we extend our SAC algorithm with Automatic Entropy Tuning and Emphasising Recent Experiences
